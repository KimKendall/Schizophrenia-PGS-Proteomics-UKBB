# UK-Biobank-Proteomics
Here you will find the code I used to process the UK Biobank Olink proteomic data and run the analyses examining the association between schizophrenia polygenic scores and blood-based proteins, and follow-up analyses.

The files required are:
- UK Biobank proteomic data (available on UKBB RAP)
- SCZ PRS (previously calculated by Dr Sophie Legge for this paper doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2024.0200)
- Ancestry probabilities (previously calculated by Dr Eilidh Fenner for this paper doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.14.23294074)
- Phenotypic data
- Olink helper files available from the data showcase https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=1839
